# Branching Patterns with JavaScript and p5.js

This repository contains a JavaScript code snippet that generates mesmerizing branching patterns using the p5.js library. By adjusting the sliders, you can create captivating visuals reminiscent of natural tree structures.

## Getting Started

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Prerequisites

To run the code, you need a web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.

## Usage

Once the code is running in your browser, you will see a canvas with sliders and a branching pattern. The sliders control the rotation angles of the branches, allowing you to interactively modify the visual output. Experiment with different angles to create your own unique patterns!

## Code Explanation

The main code is written in JavaScript using the p5.js library, which provides an easy-to-use framework for creative coding and visualization. The `setup` function initializes the canvas and sliders, while the `draw` function continuously updates the canvas and draws the branching pattern. The `branch` function is a recursive function responsible for drawing the branches.
